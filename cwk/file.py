NO FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE ADDED OR REMOVED FROM THIS MODULE. SIMPLY COMPLETE EACH FUNCTION AS DESCRIBED.

    """
    Task 1: Return the path to the sales data file.
    
    The function should return the value of the relative file path variable.

    :return: A string which is the path to the sales data file.

def load_data():
    """
    Task 2: Load data from the sales data file.

    The function should read the headings and each record from the sales data file.
    The function should return a tuple containing both a list of headings and a list of records.

    For higher marks (advance task):
        - Values in a record stored in the list of records should be of the correct type.
        - For example, record ids should be stored as integers, postal codes should be stored as integers and profit
        should be stored as float. Dates can be stored as strings.
        - Modify the function so that it stores values in each record with the correct type.

    For even higher marks (advance task):
        - the function should indicate the progress made by invoking the tui module's status function.
        - the progress message should be of the form 'Loaded records... (X)%'
        where 'X' is a whole number that indicates the percentage of records that have been loaded.
        - the progress message should only be displayed each time another 10% of the records have been loaded
        (i.e when 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of records have been loaded)
        - the progress message should not be displayed when no records (0%) have been loaded or
        all the records (100%) have been loaded

    :return: A tuple where the first item is a list containing the headings
    and the second item is a list containing the records
