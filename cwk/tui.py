TUI is short for Text-User Interface. This module is responsible for communicating with the user.
The functions in this module will display information to the user and/or retrieve a response from the user.
Each function in this module should utilise any parameters it receives and perform user input/output.
A function may also need to format and/or structure a response e.g. return a list, tuple, etc.
Any errors or invalid inputs should be handled appropriately and as specified.
Please note that you do not need to read the data file or perform any other such processing in this module.
